feat(monitoring): Implement service availability monitoring

# Why:
# The ISP Management Platform needs a robust service monitoring system to track
# the health and availability of critical services, detect outages, and manage
# maintenance windows. This feature enhances system reliability and provides
# better visibility into service performance.

# What:
# - Added service endpoint management for HTTP, HTTPS, TCP, UDP, DNS, and ICMP services
# - Implemented automatic outage detection and tracking
# - Created maintenance window scheduling and management
# - Developed comprehensive Elasticsearch integration for data storage and visualization
# - Added Kibana dashboards for service health monitoring
# - Created unit tests for all components
# - Added database migration scripts
# - Updated CI/CD pipeline for the monitoring module

# How:
# - Created database models for service endpoints, statuses, outages, and maintenance windows
# - Implemented collectors for gathering service availability metrics
# - Added Celery tasks for scheduled service checks
# - Developed RESTful API endpoints for managing service monitoring
# - Integrated with Elasticsearch for efficient data storage and retrieval
# - Created Kibana visualizations for monitoring dashboards

# Testing:
# - Added comprehensive unit tests for all components
# - Created test fixtures and mocks for dependencies
# - Implemented test script for easy test execution
# - Added test coverage reporting

# Related Issues:
# - #123: Service monitoring requirements
# - #124: Elasticsearch integration for monitoring data
# - #125: Kibana dashboards for service health

# Breaking Changes:
# None

# Deployment Notes:
# - Run database migrations: `python scripts/run_migrations.py`
# - Restart Celery workers: `systemctl restart isp-celery`
# - Update Elasticsearch templates: `python scripts/update_es_templates.py`

# Documentation:
