## Development Workflow

Follow these steps when making changes to the authentication module:

1. **Create a Feature Branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   git pull origin develop
   git checkout -b feature/auth-feature-name
   ```

2. **Implement Changes**
   - Follow the existing code style and patterns
   - Keep changes focused and modular
   - Add appropriate error handling
   - Add logging for important events

3. **Write Tests**
   - Add unit tests for all new functionality
   - Update existing tests if behavior changes
   - Add integration tests for API endpoints
   - Ensure all tests pass before submitting a PR

4. **Update Documentation**
   - Update API documentation
   - Update user documentation if user-facing features change
   - Add code comments for complex logic

5. **Create Pull Request**
   - Provide a detailed description of changes
   - Link to relevant issues
   - Request reviews from security-focused team members
   - Address all review comments

## Testing Requirements

The authentication module requires comprehensive testing:

### Unit Tests

- **Password Handling**: Test hashing, verification, and password policies
- **Token Management**: Test creation, validation, and blacklisting
- **User Authentication**: Test login flows, account lockout, and MFA
- **Session Management**: Test session creation, validation, and termination
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Test permission checks for different roles

### Integration Tests

- **API Endpoints**: Test all authentication endpoints
- **Error Handling**: Test error responses and status codes
- **Rate Limiting**: Test rate limiting functionality
- **Token Flows**: Test complete authentication flows

### Security Tests

- **Vulnerability Testing**: Check for common security issues
- **Penetration Testing**: Perform periodic penetration testing
- **Dependency Scanning**: Regularly scan for vulnerable dependencies

### Test Coverage

- Aim for at least 90% test coverage for the authentication module
- Run coverage reports before submitting PRs:
  ```bash
  python -m pytest tests/auth/ --cov=backend_core.auth_service --cov-report=term-missing
  ```

## Code Review Checklist

Use this checklist when reviewing authentication-related changes:

### Security

- [ ] Password handling follows best practices
- [ ] Tokens are properly validated
- [ ] Sensitive data is not logged
- [ ] Rate limiting is properly implemented
- [ ] Input validation is thorough
- [ ] SQL injection protections are in place
- [ ] CSRF protections are implemented
- [ ] Authentication bypass vulnerabilities are addressed

### Functionality

- [ ] All requirements are implemented
- [ ] Edge cases are handled
- [ ] Error handling is appropriate
- [ ] Performance impact is acceptable

### Code Quality

- [ ] Code follows project style guidelines
- [ ] Code is modular and maintainable
- [ ] No unnecessary complexity
- [ ] No duplicate code
- [ ] Appropriate logging is implemented

### Testing

- [ ] All new functionality has tests
- [ ] Tests are comprehensive
- [ ] Tests are isolated and deterministic
- [ ] Test coverage is sufficient

### Documentation

- [ ] Code is well-commented
- [ ] API documentation is updated
- [ ] User documentation is updated if needed

## Security Considerations

The authentication module is security-critical. Always follow these principles:

### Password Handling

- Use bcrypt for password hashing
- Never store plaintext passwords
- Implement password complexity requirements
- Enforce password rotation policies

### Token Security

- Use short-lived access tokens
- Implement token blacklisting
- Use secure token storage on clients
- Include appropriate token claims

### Session Security

- Track user sessions
- Allow users to view and terminate sessions
- Implement automatic session timeout
- Record IP and device information

### Multi-Factor Authentication

- Implement TOTP-based MFA
- Provide recovery options
- Allow remembering trusted devices
- Enforce MFA for sensitive operations

### Audit Logging

- Log all authentication events
- Log all security-related actions
- Include relevant context in logs
- Never log sensitive information

## Backward Compatibility

Maintain backward compatibility to avoid breaking client applications:

- Do not remove existing endpoints
- Do not change response formats without versioning
- Use feature flags for major changes
- Provide deprecation notices before removing features
- Support multiple authentication methods during transitions

## Documentation Requirements

Keep documentation up-to-date with all changes:

### API Documentation

- Update `docs/core/auth_api_reference.md` with any API changes
- Document request/response formats
- Document error responses
- Include examples

### Implementation Documentation

- Update `docs/core/authentication.md` with implementation details
- Document class and method changes
- Update architecture diagrams if needed

### Testing Documentation

- Update `docs/core/auth_testing_guide.md` with new testing approaches
- Document test fixtures and mocks
- Provide examples of testing new features

## Deployment Considerations

Follow these guidelines when deploying authentication changes:

### Pre-Deployment

- Run full test suite
- Perform security review
- Test in staging environment
- Prepare rollback plan

### Deployment

- Use feature flags for gradual rollout
- Monitor logs during deployment
- Watch for increased error rates
- Be prepared to rollback if issues occur

### Post-Deployment

- Monitor authentication metrics
- Watch for unusual patterns
- Collect user feedback
- Address any issues promptly

## Conclusion

The authentication module is a critical component of the ISP Management Platform. By following these guidelines, we can ensure it remains secure, stable, and maintainable as the system evolves.
