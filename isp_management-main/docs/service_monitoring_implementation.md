# Service Availability Monitoring Implementation Guide

## Overview

The Service Availability Monitoring feature is a critical component of the ISP Management Platform's Monitoring Module. It provides real-time monitoring of network services and endpoints, detects outages, and manages maintenance windows. This document outlines the implementation details, architecture, and usage guidelines.

## Architecture

The Service Availability Monitoring feature follows the platform's microservices architecture with a modular monolith core. It integrates with the following platform components:

- **Database**: PostgreSQL for persistent storage of monitoring data
- **Caching**: Redis for caching service status and reducing database load
- **Logging**: Elasticsearch for centralized logging and metrics collection
- **Task Queue**: Celery for scheduled service checks and background processing
- **API**: FastAPI for RESTful API endpoints

## Core Components

### 1. Models

- **ServiceEndpoint**: Represents a service endpoint to be monitored
  - Supports various protocols (HTTP, HTTPS, TCP, UDP, ICMP, DNS)
  - Configurable check intervals, timeouts, and retry settings
  - Expected status codes and response patterns for HTTP/HTTPS

- **ServiceStatus**: Records the status of a service check
  - Tracks response time, status (UP, DOWN, DEGRADED, MAINTENANCE)
  - Includes timestamp and error messages if applicable
  - Elasticsearch synchronization status

- **ServiceOutage**: Represents a detected service outage
  - Start and end times
  - Severity level (CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW)
  - Resolution status and notes

- **MaintenanceWindow**: Defines scheduled maintenance periods
  - Associated with specific service endpoints
  - Start and end times
  - Active status

### 2. Collectors

- **ServiceAvailabilityCollector**: Core component for checking service availability
  - Protocol-specific check methods (HTTP, HTTPS, TCP, UDP, ICMP, DNS)
  - Aggregation of service statuses
  - Elasticsearch synchronization

### 3. Services

- **AvailabilityService**: Business logic for service endpoint management
  - CRUD operations for service endpoints
  - Service status checking and processing

- **OutageManagementService**: Handles outage detection and management
  - Outage detection based on consecutive failures
  - Maintenance window management
  - Notification triggers

### 4. Tasks

- **ServiceAvailabilityTasks**: Celery tasks for automated monitoring
  - Scheduled service checks
  - Outage detection
  - Elasticsearch synchronization

### 5. Routes

- **MonitoringRoutes**: FastAPI routes for the monitoring API
  - Endpoint management
  - Status retrieval
  - Outage management
  - Maintenance window scheduling

## Elasticsearch Integration

The Service Availability Monitoring feature integrates with Elasticsearch for centralized logging and metrics collection:

1. **Data Synchronization**: Service statuses are synchronized to Elasticsearch
2. **Bulk Indexing**: Efficient bulk indexing for large volumes of monitoring data
3. **Kibana Dashboards**: Pre-configured dashboards for visualizing service health
4. **Alerting**: Elasticsearch alerting for outage detection

## Testing

The feature includes comprehensive testing:

1. **Unit Tests**: Tests for individual components
2. **Integration Tests**: Tests for component interactions
3. **Standalone Tests**: Tests that can run without external dependencies
4. **Mock Objects**: Mocks for external dependencies (Redis, Elasticsearch)

## Usage Guidelines

### 1. Service Endpoint Management

```python
# Create a new service endpoint
endpoint_data = {
    "name": "Example API",
    "url": "https://api.example.com/health",
    "protocol": ProtocolType.HTTPS,
    "check_interval": 60,
    "timeout": 5,
    "retries": 3,
    "expected_status_code": 200,
    "expected_pattern": "healthy",
    "is_active": True
}
endpoint = availability_service.create_endpoint(endpoint_data)

# Update an endpoint
update_data = {
    "check_interval": 120,
    "timeout": 10
}
updated = availability_service.update_endpoint(endpoint.id, update_data)

# Deactivate an endpoint
deactivated = availability_service.update_endpoint(endpoint.id, {"is_active": False})
```

### 2. Maintenance Window Scheduling

```python
# Schedule a maintenance window
window_data = {
    "endpoint_id": endpoint.id,
    "name": "Scheduled Maintenance",
    "description": "System upgrade",
    "start_time": datetime.utcnow() + timedelta(days=1),
    "end_time": datetime.utcnow() + timedelta(days=1, hours=2),
    "is_active": True
}
window = outage_service.create_maintenance_window(window_data)

# Check if a service is in maintenance
in_maintenance = outage_service.is_in_maintenance(endpoint.id)
```

### 3. Manual Service Checks

```python
# Check a specific service
status = availability_service.check_service(endpoint.id)

# Check all active services
results = collector.collect_all_services()
```

## Deployment

The Service Availability Monitoring feature can be deployed using the provided deployment script:

```bash
./scripts/deploy_service_monitoring.sh
```

This script:
1. Updates the database schema
2. Configures Elasticsearch indices
3. Sets up Celery tasks
4. Deploys API endpoints

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

1. **Connection Errors**: Ensure that the monitored services are accessible from the monitoring server
2. **Redis Connection Issues**: Verify Redis connection settings
3. **Elasticsearch Synchronization Failures**: Check Elasticsearch cluster health
4. **Import Errors in Tests**: Use the standalone test script for isolated testing

## Conclusion

The Service Availability Monitoring feature provides comprehensive monitoring capabilities for the ISP Management Platform. By following this implementation guide, you can effectively monitor service availability, detect outages, and manage maintenance windows.
